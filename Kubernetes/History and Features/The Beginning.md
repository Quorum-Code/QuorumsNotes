# The Word Kubernetes
Kubernetes comes from a Greek word meaning helmsman or ship pilot. 

## Aliases
Another term used to refer to Kubernetes is k8s (pronounced as Kates), because there are 8 characters between k and s.

# The Source
Kubernetes is highly inspired by the Google Borg system, another container and workload orchestrator for Google's operations, which has been in use for more than a decade. 

Despite Google Borg being internal software, Kubernetes was also initially developed at Google with a v1.0 release in July of 2015. Google donated the project to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), one of the largest sub-foundations of the Linux Foundation.

## Borg to Kubernetes
Borg is a critical system in the Google eco-system, for more than a decade it has supported services such as Gmail, Drive, Maps, Docs and more, which all use Borg. 

Some of the features that were carried over from Borg to Kubernetes are API servers, Pods, IP-per-Pod, Service, and Labels.
