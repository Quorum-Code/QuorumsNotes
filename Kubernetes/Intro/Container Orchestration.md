# What is It?
Within the realm of Development environments, running containers on a single host for development is an option it's not the only one. When you want to run many containers across many machines Container Orchestration will reduce the required work significantly.

Container orchestration is closely related to distributed systems and achieves many of its advantages, such as increased performance, cost efficiency, reliability, workload distribution, and reduced latency.
## Meeting Business Needs
Many containers help meet requirements such as increased fault-tolerance, on-demand scalability, optimal resources usage, auto-discovery to automatically discover and communicate with each other, accessibility from the outside world, and seamless updates/rollbacks without any downtime.

## Container Orchestrators
Are tools which group systems together to form clusters where containers' deployments where needs are automatically met.

# Container Orchestrating Solutions
